The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Astronomy Domine,1967-08-05,"""Moon in both [houses]...""...Scorpio, [Arabian Skies], Libra...""...Pluto was not discovered until 1930...""
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
A fight between the blue you once knew
Floating down, the sound resounds
Around the icy waters underground
Jupiter and Saturn, Oberon, Miranda and Titania
Neptune, Titan, stars can frighten

Blinding signs flap
Flicker, flicker, flicker, blam
Pow, pow
Stairway scare Dan Dare whoâ€™s there?

Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters under
Lime and limpid green, the sound surrounds
The icy waters underground"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Lucifer Sam,1967-08-05,"Lucifer Sam, siam cat
Always sitting by your side
Always by your side

That catâ€™s something I canâ€™t explain

Jennifer Gentle, youâ€™re a witch
Youâ€™re the left side, heâ€™s the right side
Oh, no!

That catâ€™s something I canâ€™t explain

Lucifer, go to sea
Be a hip cat, be a shipâ€™s cat
Somewhere, anywhere

That catâ€™s something I canâ€™t explain

At night prowling, sifting sand
Hiding around on the ground
Heâ€™ll be found when youâ€™re around

That catâ€™s something I canâ€™t explain"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Matilda Mother,1967-08-05,"There was a king who ruled the land
His Majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people...

Oh, Mother
Tell me more

Whyâ€™dâ€™ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
Theyâ€™re scribbly black and everything shines

Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes, they did


For all the time spent in that room
The dollâ€™s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

Oh, Mother
Tell me more
Tell me more

Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Flaming,1967-08-05,"Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown

Yippee! You canâ€™t see me
But I can you

Lazing in the foggy dew
Sitting on a unicorn

No fair, you canâ€™t hear me
But I can you

Watching buttercups cup the light
Sleeping on a dandelion

Too much, I wonâ€™t touch you
But then I might

Screaming through the starlit sky
Traveling by telephone

Hey ho, here we go
Ever so high

Alone in the clouds all blue
Lying on an eiderdown

Yippee! You canâ€™t see me
But I can you"

The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The Gnome,1967-08-05,"I want to tell you a story
Boutâ€™ a little man, If I can
A gnome named Grimble Crumble
And little gnomes stay in their homes
Eating, sleeping
Drinking their wine

He wore a scarlet tunic
A blue green hood, it looked quite good
He had a big adventure
Amidst the grass, fresh air at last
Wining, dining
Biding his time

And then one day
Hooray!
Another way for gnomes to say
Ooooooh my

Look at the sky, look at the river
Isnâ€™t it good?
Look at the sky, look at the river
Isnâ€™t it good?
Winding, finding places to go

The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Chapter 24,1967-08-05,"All movement is accomplished in six stages
And the seventh brings return
The seven is the number of the young light
It forms when darkness is increased by one

Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset

The time is with the month of winter solstice
When the change is due to come
Thunder in the other course of heaven
Things cannot be destroyed once and for all

Change returns success
Going and coming without error
Action brings good fortune
Sunset, sunrise

The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,The Scarecrow,1967-08-05,"The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
He didnâ€™t care

He stood in a field where barley grows

His head did no thinking
His arms didnâ€™t move except when the wind cut up rough
And mice ran around on the ground

He stood in a field where barley grows

The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now heâ€™s resigned to his fate
â€˜Cause lifeâ€™s not unkind â€“ he doesnâ€™t mind

He stood in a field where barley grows"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,Bike,1967-08-05,"Iâ€™ve got a bike, you can ride it if you like
Itâ€™s got a basket, a bell that rings
And things to make it look good
Iâ€™d give it to you if I could, but I borrowed it

Youâ€™re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
Iâ€™ll give you anything, everything if you want things

Iâ€™ve got a cloak itâ€™s a bit of a joke
Thereâ€™s a tear up the front
Itâ€™s red and black, Iâ€™ve had it for months
If you think it could look good, then I guess it should

Youâ€™re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
Iâ€™ll give you anything, everything if you want things

I know a mouse, and he hasnâ€™t got a house
I donâ€™t know why I call him Gerald
Heâ€™s getting rather old, but heâ€™s a good mouse

Youâ€™re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
Iâ€™ll give you anything, everything if you want things

Iâ€™ve got a clan of gingerbread men
Here a man, there a man, lots of gingerbread men
Take a couple if you wish. Theyâ€™re on the dish

Youâ€™re the kind of girl that fits in with my world
Iâ€™ll give you anything, everything if you want things

I know a room of musical tunes
Some rhyme, some ching, most of them are clockwork
Letâ€™s go into the other room and make them work"
The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,See Emily Play,1967-06-16,"Emily tries but misunderstands (ah ooh)
Sheâ€™s often inclined to borrow somebodyâ€™s dreams â€™til tomorrow

There is no other day
Letâ€™s try it another way
Youâ€™ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Soon after dark, Emily cries (ah ooh)
Gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound â€™til tomorrow

There is no other day
Letâ€™s try it another way
Youâ€™ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

Put on a gown that touches the ground (ah ooh)
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily (Emily)

A Saucerful of Secrets,Let There Be More Light,1968-06-29,"Far, far, far, far away â€“ way
People heard him say â€“ say
I will find a way â€“ way
There will come a day â€“ day
Something will be done

Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race
At Mildenhall

Now, now, now is the time â€“ time
Time to be â€“ be â€“ be aware

Carterâ€™s father saw him there and
Knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

Oh, my, something in my eye â€“ eye
Something in the sky â€“ sky
Waiting there for me

The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
Was Lucy in the sky

Oh â€“ oh â€“ did you ever know â€“ know
Never ever will they
I cannot say

Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his toes
His psychic emanations flowed"
A Saucerful of Secrets,Remember a Day,1968-06-29,"Remember a day before today
A day when you were young
Free to play alone with time
Evening never come

Sing a song that canâ€™t be sung
Without the morningâ€™s kiss
Queen â€“ you shall be it if you wish
Look for your king

Why canâ€™t we play today?
Why canâ€™t we stay that way?

Climb your favourite apple tree
Try to catch the sun
Hide from your little brotherâ€™s gun
Dream yourself away

Why canâ€™t we reach the sun?
Why canâ€™t we blow the years away?
Blow away
Blow away
Remember
Remember
Remember"
A Saucerful of Secrets,Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun,1968-06-29,"Little by little the night turns around
Counting the leaves which tremble at dawn
Lotuses lean on each other in yearning
Under the eaves the swallow is resting

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

Over the mountain watching the watcher
Breaking the darkness, waking the grapevine
One inch of love is one inch of shadow
Love is the shadow that ripens the wine

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun
The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

Witness the man who raves at the wall
Making the shape of his question to Heaven
Whether the sun will fall in the evening
Will he remember the lesson of giving?

Set the controls for the heart of the sun

The heart of the sun, the heart of the sun

A Saucerful of Secrets,Corporal Clegg,1968-06-29,"Corporal Clegg had a wooden leg
He won it in the war
In 1944
Corporal Clegg had a medal too
In orange, red, and blue
He found it in the zoo
Dear oh dear oh were they really sad for me?
Dear oh dear oh will they really laugh at me?

Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?

Corporal Clegg umbrella in the rain
Heâ€™s never been the same
No one is to blame
Corporal Clegg received his medal in a dream
From Her Majesty the Queen
His boots were very clean

Mrs. Clegg, you must be proud of him
Mrs. Clegg, another drop of gin?"

A Saucerful of Secrets,See-Saw,1968-06-29,"Marigolds are very much in love
But he doesnâ€™t mind
Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the see-saw land
All the way
She smiles

She goes up while he goes down, down

Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sisterâ€™s throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesnâ€™t know so then

She goes up while he goes down, down

Another time, aaah
Another day, aaah
A brotherâ€™s way to leave
Another time, aaah
Another day, aaah

Sheâ€™ll be selling plastic flowers
On a Sunday afternoon
Picking up weeds, she hasnâ€™t got the time to care
All can see
Heâ€™s not there

She grows up for another man, and heâ€™s down

Another time, another day
A brotherâ€™s way to leave
Another time, another day
Another time, another day
A brotherâ€™s way to leave"
A Saucerful of Secrets,Jugband Blues,1968-06-29,"Itâ€™s awfully considerate of you to think of me here
And Iâ€™m most obliged to you for making it clear that Iâ€™m not here
And I never knew the moon could be so big
And I never knew the moon could be so blue
And Iâ€™m grateful that you threw away my old shoes
And brought me here instead dressed in red
And Iâ€™m wondering who could be writing this song

I donâ€™t care if the sun donâ€™t shine
And I donâ€™t care if nothing is mine
And I donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m nervous with you
Iâ€™ll do my loving in the winter

And the sea isnâ€™t green
And I love the Queen
And what exactly is a dream?
And what exactly is a joke?"

Lazing in the haze of midday
Laughing in the grasses and the graves
Yellow bird, you are not lone
In singing and in flying on
In laughing and in leaving
Willow weeping in the water
Waving to the river daughters
Swaying in the ripples and the reeds
On a trip to Cirrus Minor
Saw a crater in the sun
A thousand miles of moonlight later"
More (Original Film Soundtrack),The Nile Song,1969-06-13,"I was standing by the Nile
When I saw the lady smile
I would take her out for a while
For a while

Like tears left like a child
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly

Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases
She will make it to the islands in the sun

I will follow in her shadow
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye

She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down"

Shade my eyes and I can see you
White is the light that shines through the dress that you wore

She lay in the shadow of the wave
Hazy were the visions of her playing
Sunlight on her eyes but moonshine made her blind evâ€™ry time

Green is the colour of her kind
Quickness of the eye deceives the mind
Envy is the bond between the hopeful and the damned"
More (Original Film Soundtrack),Cymbaline,1969-06-13,"The path you tread is narrow and the drop is shear and very high

Will the tightrope reach the end? Will the final couplet rhyme?

And itâ€™s high time, Cymbaline
Itâ€™s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

A butterfly with broken wings is falling by your side
The ravens all are closing in, thereâ€™s nowhere you can hide
Your manager and agent are both busy on the phone
Selling coloured photographs to magazines back home

And itâ€™s high time, Cymbaline
Itâ€™s high time, Cymbaline
Please, wake me

The lines converging where you stand
They must have moved the picture plane
The leaves are heavy around your feet
You hear the thunder of the train
And suddenly it strikes you that theyâ€™re moving into range
And Doctor Strange is always changing size

And itâ€™s high time! (high time), Cymbaline

So build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind

Iâ€™ve aged and aged since the first page
Iâ€™ve lived every line that you wrote
Take me down, take me down
From the shelf above your head

And build me a time
When the characters rhyme
And the story line is kind

I live where Iâ€™m left
On the shelf like the rest
And the epilogue reads like a sad song
Please pick up your camera
And use me again

When the characters rhyme
And the storyline is kind

Misty morning whisperings and gentle stirring sounds
Belied the deathly silence that lay all around

Hear the lark and harken to the barking of the dog fox
Gone to ground
See the splashing of the kingfisher flashing to the water
And a river of green is sliding unseen beneath the trees
Laughing as it passes through the endless summer, making for the sea

Basking in the sunshine of a bygone afternoon
Bringing sounds of yesterday into this city room

Rest your aching limbs for a little bit

Perhaps a day will come
When the lights will be as clear as on that morning

Rest your aching limbs for a little bit

Atom Heart Mother,If,1970-10-02,"If I were a swan, Iâ€™d be gone

Iâ€™d talk with you more often than I do

If I were asleep, I could dream
If I were afraid, I could hide
If I go insane
Please donâ€™t put your wires in my brain

If I were the moon, Iâ€™d be cool
If I were a rule, I would bend
If I were a good man
Iâ€™d understand the spaces between friends

Would you like to say something before you leave?

Perhaps youâ€™d care to state exactly how you feel

We say goodbye before weâ€™ve said hello

I hardly even like you, I shouldnâ€™t care at all

We met just six hours ago, the music was too loud

From your bed I gained a day and lost a bloody year


And I would like to know:

How do you feel?

How do you feel? Oh

How do you feel?

How do you feel? Oh

Pa-pa paaaa pa-pa pap pa paaaaa

Occasionally you showed a smile but what was the need

I felt the cold far too soon in a room of 95

My friends are lying in the sun, I wish that I was there

Tomorrow brings another town another girl like you

Have you time before you leave to greet another man?


Just you let me know:

How do you feel?

How do you feel? Oh

How do you feel?

Atom Heart Mother,Fat Old Sun,1970-10-02,"When the fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Summer Sunday and a year
The sound of music in my ears

Distant bells, new mown grass smells
Song sweet
By the river holding hands
Roll me up and lay me down

And if you see, donâ€™t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

When that fat old sun in the sky is falling
Summer evening birds are calling
Childrenâ€™s laughter in my ears
The last sunlight disappears

And if you see, donâ€™t make a sound
Pick your feet up off the ground
And if you hear as the warm night falls
The silver sound from a tongue so strange
Sing to me, sing to me

When that fat old sun in the sky is falling"
Atom Heart Mother,Alanâ€™s Psychedelic Breakfast,1970-10-02,"
Oh, uh, me flakes, then uh, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes... toast, coffee... marmalade, I like marmalade. Yes, porridge is nice. Any cereal, I like all cereals... oh God. Kickoff is 10am


Breakfast in Los Angeles, macrobiotic stuff


I donâ€™t mind a barrack where I can bury my stuff in

I got a terrible back. When I work, it hurts me

Meddle,A Pillow of Winds,1971-10-31,"A cloud of eiderdown
Draws around me
Softening a sound

Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And sheâ€™s breathing low

And the candle dies

When night comes down, you lock the door
The book falls to the floor
As darkness falls, the waves roll by
The seasons change, the wind is warm

Now wakes the owl, now sleeps the swan
Behold a dream, the dream is gone
Green fields, a cold rain is falling
In a golden dawn


And deep beneath the ground
The early morning sounds
And I go down

Sleepy time, when I lie
With my love by my side
And sheâ€™s breathing low

And I rise, like a bird
In the haze, when the first rays
Touch the sky
And the night winds die"
Meddle,Fearless,1971-10-31,"You say the hillâ€™s too steep to climb
Chiding
You say youâ€™d like to see me try
Climbing
You pick the place and Iâ€™ll choose the time

And I will climb that hill in my own way
Just wait a while for the right day
And as I rise above the tree line and the clouds
I look down, hearing the sound of the things youâ€™ve said today

Fearlessly the idiot faced the crowd
Smiling
Merciless the magistrate turns â€™round
Frowning
And whoâ€™s the fool who wears the crown?

And go down in your own way
And every day is the right day
And as you rise above the fear-lines in his brow
You look down, hearing the sound of the faces in the crowd

Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart
And youâ€™ll never walk alone
Youâ€™ll never walk alone
Liverpool! Liverpool!"
Meddle,San Tropez,1971-10-31,"As I reach for a peach, slide a rind down behind
The sofa in San Tropez
Breakinâ€™ a stick with a brick on the sand
Ridinâ€™ a wave in the wake of an old sedan
Sleepinâ€™ alone in the drone of the darkness
Scratched by the sand that fell from my love
Deep in my dreams and I still hear her callinâ€™

â€œIf youâ€™re alone, Iâ€™ll come ho-ho-homeâ€?

Backward and homebound, the pigeon, the dove
Gone with the wind and the rain, on an airplane
Born in a home with no silver spoon
Iâ€™m drinking champagne like a good tycoon
Sooner than wait for a break in the weather
Iâ€™ll gather my far-flung thoughts together
Speeding away on the wind to a new day

If youâ€™re alone, Iâ€™ll come ho-ho-home

And I pause for a while by a country stile
And listen to the things they say
Digginâ€™ for gold in a hole in my hand
Open a book, take a look at the way things stand
And youâ€™re leading me down to the place by the sea
I hear your soft voice calling to me
Making a date for later by phone

And if youâ€™re alone, Iâ€™ll come ho-ho-home"

Meddle,Echoes,1971-10-30,"Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the whereâ€™s or whyâ€™s
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb towards the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun


Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky"

Flickering between the lines
Stolen moments floating softly on the air
Born on wings of fire and climbing higher

Ancient bonds are breaking
Moving on and changing sides
Dreaming of a new day
Cast aside the other way
(Magic vision stirring
Kindled by and burning
Flames rise in her eyes)

The door stands ajar
The walls that once were high
Beyond the gilded cage
Beyond the reach of ties
The moment is at hand
She breaks the golden band"

Because Iâ€™m only coming along for the ride

Well, you go your way
Iâ€™ll go mine
I donâ€™t care if we get there on time
Everybodyâ€™s searching for something, they say
Iâ€™ll get my kicks on the way

Over the mountains, across the sea
Who knows what will be waiting for me?
I could sail forever to strange sounding names
Faces of people and places donâ€™t change

All I have to do is just close my eyes
To see the seagulls wheeling in those far distant skies
All I want to tell you, all I want to say
Is count me in on the journey
Donâ€™t expect me to stay"

You shout in your sleep

Perhaps the price is just too steep

Is your conscience at rest

If once put to the test?

You awake with a start

To just the beating of your heart

Just one man beneath the sky

Just two ears, just two eyes


You set sail across the sea

Of long past thoughts and memories

Childhoodâ€™s end, your fantasies

Merge with harsh realities

And then as the sail is hoist

You find your eyes are growing moist

All the fears never voiced

Say you have to make your final choice


Who are you and who am I

To say we know the reason why?

Some are born; some men die

Beneath one infinite sky

Thereâ€™ll be war, thereâ€™ll be peace

But everything one day will cease

All the iron turned to rust;

All the proud men turned to dust

And so all things, time will mend

So this song will end

Obscured By Clouds,Free Four,1972-06-02,"One, two, free, four!
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom of the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die
Life is a short, warm moment
And death is a long cold rest
You get your chance to try in the twinkling of an eye:
Eighty years, with luck, or even less
So all aboard for the American tour
And maybe youâ€™ll make it to the top
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, â€™cause I know
You may find it hard to get off
You are the angel of death
And I am the dead manâ€™s son
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole
And everyone is still on the run
And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?
The memories of a man in his old age
Are the deeds of a man in his prime
You shuffle in gloom in the sickroom
And talk to yourself as you die"

Burning gold
A yellow moon

Surprised to find you by my side
Rack my brain to try to remember your name
To find the words to tell you good-bye

Absolutely years, been over the edge for yonks
Been working me buns off for bands
Iâ€™ve always been mad, I know Iâ€™ve been mad

The Dark Side of the Moon,Breathe (In the Air),1973-03-01,"Breathe, breathe in the air
Donâ€™t be afraid to care
Leave but donâ€™t leave me
Look around and choose your own ground

For long you live and high you fly
And smiles youâ€™ll give and tears youâ€™ll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Donâ€™t sit down, itâ€™s time to dig another one

For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race towards an early grave"

The Dark Side of the Moon,Time,1973-03-01,"Ticking away the moments that make up the dull day
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today
And then, one day, you find, ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun


And you run, and you run to catch up with the sun, but itâ€™s sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way, but youâ€™re older
Shorter of breath, and one day closer to death
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over, thought Iâ€™d something more to say


Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
And when I come home cold and tired
Itâ€™s good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells"

And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You got to strike when the moment is right without thinking
And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you
Youâ€™ll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know, itâ€™s going to get harder, and harder, and harder
As you get older
Yeah, and in the end youâ€™ll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer


And when you lose control, youâ€™ll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And itâ€™s too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down all alone
Dragged down by the stone

(Stone, stone, stone...)

Gotta admit that Iâ€™m a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if Iâ€™m just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I donâ€™t stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze

Who was fitted with collar and chain

Who was breaking away from the pack
Who was only a stranger at home
Who was ground down in the end
Who was found dead on the phone
Who was dragged down by the stone

With all their kids committing suicide
What have we done, Maggie, what have we done?
What have we done to England?

Should we shout, should we scream
â€œWhat happened to the post war dream?â€?
Oh, Maggie, Maggie, what did we do?"
The Final Cut,Your Possible Pasts,1983-03-21,"They flutter behind you your possible pasts
Some bright-eyed and crazy, some frightened and lost
A warning to anyone still in command
â€œRanks! Fire!â€?
Of their possible future, to take care
In derelict sidings the poppies entwine
With cattle trucks lying in wait for the next time

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?

She stood in the doorway, the ghost of a smile
Haunting her face like a cheap hotel sign
Her cold eyes imploring the men in their Macs
For the gold in their bags or the knives in their backs
Stepping up boldly one put out his hand
He said, â€œI was just a child then, now Iâ€™m only a man.â€?

Do you remember me? How we used to be?
Do you think we should be closer?

By the cold and religious we were taken in hand
Shown how to feel good and told to feel bad
(Tongue tied and terrified we learned how to pray
Now our feelings run deep and cold as the clay)
Strung out behind us the banners and flags
Of our possible pasts lie in tatters and rags

Do you think we should be closer?"

The Final Cut,When the Tigers Broke Free,1982-07-15,"It was just before dawn one miserable
Morning in black Forty-Four
When the forward commander was told to sit tight
When he asked that his men be withdrawn
And the Generals gave thanks as the other ranks
Held back the enemy tanks for a while
And the Anzio bridgehead was held for the price
Of a few hundred ordinary lives

And kind old King George sent Mother a note
When he heard that Father was gone
It was, I recall, in the form of a scroll
With gold leaf and all
And I found it one day
In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away
And my eyes still grow damp to remember
His Majesty signed with his own rubber stamp

It was dark all around, there was frost in the ground
When the Tigers broke free
And no one survived
From the Royal Fusiliers Company Z
They were all left behind
Most of them dead, the rest of them dying
And that's how the High Command
Took my daddy from me"

I had a dream
I had a dream
Good-bye Max
Good-bye Ma
After the service, when youâ€™re walking slowly to the car
And the silver in her hair shines in the cold November air
You hear the tolling bell
And touch the silk in your lapel
And as the tear drops rise to meet the comfort of the band
You take her frail hand
And hold on to the dream!
A place to stay
â€œOi! A real one â€¦â€?
Enough to eat
Somewhere old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud
About your doubts and fears
And whatâ€™s more no-one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs donâ€™t blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no one kills the children anymore
And no one kills the children anymore
Night after night
Going round and round my brain
His dream is driving me insane
In the corner of some foreign field
The gunner sleeps tonight
Whatâ€™s done is done
We cannot just write off his final scene
Take heed of the dream
Take heed"

Fixing your grin as you casually lean on the bar
Laughing too loud at the rest of the world

I can barely define the shape of this moment in time
And far from flying high in clear blue skies
I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide

And beat the dogs and cheat the cold electronic eyes
And if you make it past the shotguns in the hall
Dial the combination, open the priesthole
And if I'm in I'll tell you (What's behind the wall)

There's a kid who had a big hallucination
Making love to girls in magazines
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith
Could anybody love him
Or is it just a crazy dream?

And if I show you my dark side
Will you still hold me tonight?
And if I open my heart to you
And show you my weak side
What would you do?
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone?
Would you take the children away
And leave me alone?
And smile in reassurance
As you whisper down the phone?
Would you send me packing?
Or would you take me home?

Thought I oughta bare my naked feelings
Thought I oughta tear the curtain down
I held the blade in trembling hands
Prepared to make it but just then the phone rang
I never had the nerve to make the final cut

The Final Cut,Two Suns in the Sunset,1983-03-21,"In my rear view mirror the sun is going down
Sinking behind bridges in the road
And I think of all the good things
That we have left undone
And I suffer premonitions, confirm suspicions
Of the holocaust to come

The rusty wire that holds the cork that keeps the anger in
Gives way and suddenly itâ€™s day again
The sun is in the east
Even though the day is done
Two suns in the sunset, hmph
Could be the human race is run

Like the moment when the brakes lock
And you slide towards the big truck (â€œOh no!â€?)
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear
And youâ€™ll never hear their voices (â€?Daddy, Daddy!â€?)
And youâ€™ll never see their faces
You have no recourse to the law anymore

And as the windshield melts and my tears evaporate
Leaving only charcoal to defend
Finally I understand
The feelings of the few
Ashes and diamonds, foe and friend
We were all equal in the end

With an expected high of 4000 degrees Celsiusâ€?"

A fatal attraction is holding me fast
How can I escape this irresistible grasp?

Canâ€™t keep my eyes from the circling sky
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings, I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladen, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension thatâ€™s learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try

Canâ€™t keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted
Just an earth-bound misfit, I

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

Thereâ€™s no sensation to compare with this
Suspended animation, a state of bliss

And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

And casting its shroud

Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that weâ€™re all alone
In the dream of the proud

On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord
Using words you will find are strange
Mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of force, he was so tough
Sheâ€™ll soon submit, sheâ€™s had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still

He has fought and he has died

The babbling that I brook

A man in black on a snow white horse
A pointless life has run its course

In his youth or a dream, he canâ€™t be precise
Heâ€™s chained forever to a world thatâ€™s departed
Itâ€™s not enough, itâ€™s not enough

His hand has weakened at the moment of truth

Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea

Clear through the clouds that covered me

Thereâ€™s a silence surrounding me
I canâ€™t seem to think straight
Iâ€™ll sit in the corner
And no one can bother me
I think I should speak now (Why wonâ€™t you talk to me?)
I canâ€™t seem to speak now (You never talk to me)
My words wonâ€™t come out right (What are you thinking?)
I feel like Iâ€™m drowning (What are you feeling?)
Iâ€™m feeling weak now (Why wonâ€™t you talk to me?)
But I canâ€™t show my weakness (You never talk to me)
I sometimes wonder (What are you thinking?)
Where do we go from here (What are you feeling?)

It doesnâ€™t have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking

(Why wonâ€™t you talk to me?) I feel like Iâ€™m drowning
(You never talk to me) You know I canâ€™t breathe now
(What are you thinking?) Weâ€™re going nowhere
(What are you feeling?) Weâ€™re going nowhere
(Why wonâ€™t you talk to me?)
(You never talk to me)
(What are you thinking?)
(Where do we go from here?)

It doesnâ€™t have to be like this
All we need to do is make sure we keep talking"
The Division Bell,Lost for Words,1994-03-28,"I was spending my time in the doldrums
I was caught in a cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralysed
I thought that everything else would just wait
While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night
To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
â€˜Cause thereâ€™ll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door

â€œLadies and gentlemen!
The winner\ nBy a knockoutâ€?

Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over the door
So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask â€œcould we wipe the slate clean?â€?
But they tell me to please go fuck myself
You know you just canâ€™t win"
The Division Bell,High Hopes,1994-03-28,"Beyond the horizon of the place we lived when we were young
In a world filled with magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun
Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut
There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before time took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world


Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river
For ever and ever

Great..."""

But a lot of things unsaid as well

We shout and argue and fight, and work it on out

The Endless River,Louder than Words,2014-10-14,"We bitch and we fight
Diss each other on sight
But this thing we do
These times together
Rain or shine or stormy weather
This thing we do
With world-weary grace
We've taken our places
We could curse it or nurse it and give it a name
Or stay home by the fire, filled by desire
Stoking the flame
But weâ€™re here for the ride

It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words

The strings bend and slide
As the hours glide by
An old pair of shoes, your favorite blues
Gonna tap out the rhythm
Let's go with the flow, wherever it goes
We're more than alive

It's louder than words
This thing that we do
Louder than words
The way it unfurls
It's louder than words
The sum of our parts
The beat of our hearts
Is louder than words
Louder than words
Louder than words
This thing they call soul
Is there with a pulse
Louder than words
Louder than words"
